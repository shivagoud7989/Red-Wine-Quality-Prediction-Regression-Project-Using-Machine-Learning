# Red-Wine-Quality-Prediction-Regression-Project-Using-Machine-Learning
This is an internship project done by my group. In this project we have came across different types of about red wine and we predicted the quality by using regression.
Regression Data Description


Data Description: the dataset of red wine where we have to build a multivariate ordinary least squares regression model to predict the quality of wine . Data consist of 12 columns & 1600 rows where there are 11 feature variable (independent variable) & a dependent variable (Quality) . COMPONENTS OF WINE VARIABLES
1 fixed acidity FEATURE 2 volatile acidity FEATURE 3 citric acid FEATURE 4 residual sugar FEATURE 5 chlorides FEATURE 6 free sulfur dioxide FEATURE 7 total sulfur dioxide FEATURE 8 density FEATURE 9 pH FEATURE 10 sulphates FEATURE 11 alcohol FEATURE 12 quality TAREGET
